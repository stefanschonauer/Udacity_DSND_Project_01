- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

### Project Motivation

World Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates.

A very interesting indicator for development of different countries and regions in the world is the life expectancy. For my investigation I am interested in the following aspects:

1. How is life expectancy distributed?
2. Are there regional differences or patterns?
3. Which features support life expectancy?
4. How influences an increase of basic drinking water service the life expectancy?
5. What happens if the basic drinking water service is offered at least 75% of the people in the world?

### File Descriptions

There are two files in this repository:

- `data.csv`: Generated and downloaded file from the Worldbank databank.
- `life_expectancy.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook including the CRISP-DM to prepare and analyze the given questions in the project motivation.
- `index.html`: Blog post article with a summary of the results.
- `image_0x`: Images which support the blog post and the `index.html` file

### Results

A summary of the results in the form of a blog post can be found on my GitHub page <a href="https://stefanschonauer.github.io/Udacity_DSND_Project_01/">here</a>.
